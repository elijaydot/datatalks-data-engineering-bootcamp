# Data Engineering Zoomcamp Journey

Welcome to my repository for the **Data Engineering Zoomcamp**! This project documents my hands-on journey through modern data engineering practices, tools, and workflows over an 8-week curriculum.

Here you'll find code, notes, and solutions for each module as I progress through the course.

## Weekly Highlights

### [Week 1: Containerization & Infrastructure as Code](./week1/)
> **Focus**: Docker, PostgreSQL, SQL, Terraform, GCP

In the first week, we established the foundational infrastructure for data engineering.
- **Containerization**: Used Docker and Docker Compose to run PostgreSQL and pgAdmin.
- **Database**: Ingested NYC Green Taxi data (Nov 2025) into Postgres.
- **SQL Analysis**: Performed complex queries to analyze trip records.
- **IaC**: Provisioned cloud resources (GCS, BigQuery) on Google Cloud Platform using Terraform.

### [Week 2: Workflow Orchestration](./week2/)
> **Focus**: Kestra, Workflow Automation, Development Environment Configuration

Building on the foundational infrastructure, week two focuses on orchestrating data pipelines and automating workflows.
- **Environment Setup**: Optimized development container with Visual Studio Code extensions for seamless collaboration.
- **Security First**: Implemented proper credential management with gitignore for sensitive Google Cloud Platform credentials.
- **Workflow Automation**: Learned to build and deploy data pipelines using Kestra workflow orchestration platform.
- **YAML Workflows**: Defined complex data pipelines through version-controlled YAML configurations.
- **Local Development**: Set up comprehensive local development environment with port forwarding for Kestra, PostgreSQL, and pgAdmin.
