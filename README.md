# Data Engineering Zoomcamp Journey

Welcome to my repository for the **Data Engineering Zoomcamp**! This project documents my hands-on journey through modern data engineering practices, tools, and workflows over an 8-week curriculum.

Here you'll find code, notes, and solutions for each module as I progress through the course.

## Weekly Highlights

### [Week 1: Containerization & Infrastructure as Code](./week1/)
> **Focus**: Docker, PostgreSQL, SQL, Terraform, GCP

In the first week, we established the foundational infrastructure for data engineering.
- **Containerization**: Used Docker and Docker Compose to run PostgreSQL and pgAdmin.
- **Database**: Ingested NYC Green Taxi data (Nov 2025) into Postgres.
- **SQL Analysis**: Performed complex queries to analyze trip records.
- **IaC**: Provisioned cloud resources (GCS, BigQuery) on Google Cloud Platform using Terraform.
